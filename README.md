# PinSecurityAnalysis
This repository contains our analysis and attempt to replicate the results of the "This PIN Can Be Easily Guessed" paper by Philipp Markert, Daniel V. Bailey, Maximilian Golla, Markus DÃ¼rmuth, and Adam J. Aviv

Pin blacklists and leaked pin datasets where obtained from the original project github repository: 
https://this-pin-can-be-easily-guessed.github.io/

Note: To run the test python code you need to retrieve the blacklist and dataset files from the link above and place them on the same directory as the .py file.
